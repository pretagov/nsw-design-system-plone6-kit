The starter kit is formed of two parts a REST API backend and a React frontend. See the corresponding sections below for more details.

To get started with the starter kit, [view the demo](https://digitalnsw.pretagov.com.au/) or download the starter kit and run `make start` to try it locally.

To get started, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/)
- [`python`](https://www.python.org/)

### Create a site

1. Run `make start` to bootstrap and start both the backend and frontend.
2. Visit `localhost:8080` and create a site with an `id` of `Plone` (default). The default username and password are `admin`.
3. Visit `localhost:3000` to view your new site!

## Frontend

The starter kit frontend is made of two parts: [volto](https://plone.org/what-is-plone/volto) and the [NSW Design System addon](https://github.com/pretagov/nsw-design-system-plone6).

### Versions

The frontend was created using the latest volto version at the time of writing, [16.0.0-alpha.22](https://github.com/plone/volto/releases/tag/16.0.0-alpha.22). The frontend was bootstrapped with the Plone6 yeoman generator. See <https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/volto/getting-started/install.html#install-volto> for more info on created your own frontend.

## Backend

- Currently using Plone 6.0.0b1
- Using [buildout](https://www.buildout.org/en/latest/) to create a backend. See [Install a Plone backend locally without Docker](https://6.dev-docs.plone.org/volto/configuration/backend.html?highlight=buildout#install-a-plone-backend-locally-without-docker) in the Plone manual for more information on how this works.
- Is using [mr.developer](https://pypi.org/project/mr.developer/) to install some addons with git. Development sections are marked in the [buildout config file, `buildout.cfg`](backend/bin/Activate.ps1backend/buildout.cfg).
